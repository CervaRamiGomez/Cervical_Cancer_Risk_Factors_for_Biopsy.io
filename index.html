            <h2> Cervical Cancer Risk Factors for Biopsy:</h2>
            <p>About 11,000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S. However,
               the number of new cervical cancer cases has been declining steadily over the past decades.
                Although it is the most preventable type of cancer, each year cervical cancer kills about 4,000 women in the U.S. 
                and about 300,000 women worldwide. In the United States, cervical cancer mortality rates plunged by 74% 
                from 1955 - 1992 thanks to increased screening and early detection with the Pap test. AGE Fifty percent of cervical cancer 
                diagnoses occur in women ages 35 - 54, and about 20% occur in women over 65 years of age. The median age of diagnosis is 48 years.
                 About 15% of women develop cervical cancer between the ages of 20 - 30. Cervical cancer is extremely rare in women younger than age 20.
                  However, many young women become infected with multiple types of human papilloma virus, which then can increase their risk 
                  of getting cervical cancer in the future. Young women with early abnormal changes who do not have regular examinations are at high risk 
                  for localized cancer by the time they are age 40, and for invasive cancer by age 50. </p>

          <h2>SOCIOECONOMIC AND ETHNIC FACTORS </h2>
          <p>Although the rate of cervical cancer has declined among 
            both Caucasian and African-American women over the past decades, it remains much more prevalent in African-Americans
             -- whose death rates are twice as high as Caucasian women. Hispanic American women have more than twice the 
             risk of invasive cervical cancer as Caucasian women, also due to a lower rate of screening. 
             These differences, however, are almost certainly due to social and economic differences.
             Numerous studies report that high poverty levels are linked with low screening rates. 
             In addition, lack of health insurance, limited transportation, and language difficulties hinder a poor womanâ€™s access to screening services. </p>

          <h2> HIGH SEXUAL ACTIVITY </h2>
          <p> Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the main risk factor for cervical cancer.
             In adults, the most important risk factor for HPV is sexual activity with an infected person. Women most at risk for cervical cancer are those with a history of 
             multiple sexual partners, sexual intercourse at age 17 years or younger, or both. A woman who has never been sexually active has a very low risk 
             for developing cervical cancer. Sexual activity with multiple partners increases the likelihood of many other sexually transmitted infections (chlamydia,
              gonorrhea, syphilis).Studies have found an association between chlamydia and cervical cancer risk, including the possibility that chlamydia 
              may prolong HPV infection. FAMILY HISTORY Women have a higher risk of cervical cancer if they have a first-degree relative (mother, sister) 
              who has had cervical cancer. USE OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES Studies have reported a strong association between cervical cancer and long-term use
               of oral contraception (OC). Women who take birth control pills for more than 5 - 10 years appear to have a much higher risk HPV infection 
               (up to four times higher) than those who do not use OCs. (Women taking OCs for fewer than 5 years do not have a significantly higher risk.)  </p>

          <h2>About</h2>
          
          <p>Cervical cancer is among the 5 most common types of cancer in women worldwide. 
            Our purpose is to train an algorithm to recognize risk indicators and predict if a patient is at risk for Cervical Cancer.
            Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. Cancer is always named for the part of the body where it starts, even if it spreads to other body parts later. When cancer starts in the cervix, it is called cervical cancer. The cervix connects the vagina (birth canal) to the upper part of the uterus. The uterus (or womb) is where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant.

All women are at risk for cervical cancer. It occurs most often in women over age 30. Long-lasting infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer. HPV is a common virus that is passed from one person to another during sex. At least half of sexually active people will have HPV at some point in their lives, but few women will get cervical cancer.

Screening tests and the HPV vaccine can help prevent cervical cancer. When cervical cancer is found early, it is highly treatable and associated with long survival and good quality of life.
